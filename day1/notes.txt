1. What is a Data Structure?
-Way of organising the data in a computer for access and use.
-Types:
 -Linear Data Structure : Data arranged sequentially , elements attached.
 -Non Linear Data Structure : Not arranged sequentially.

2. Arrays?
-Linear Data Structure.
-Stores in contiguous memory 
 -C/C++: contiguous block of actual elements
 -Python / JS:
  -The array/list stores references contiguously
  -The actual objects may live elsewhere
-Offers:
 -Random access
 -Cache Freindliness
-Why O(1)?
 -Calculation > Searching
  -Formula : Address(arr[i]) = Base_Address + ( i × Size_of_Element )
-Limitation?
 -Fixed Size
 -Contiguous Memory location
 -Costly insertion and deletion
 -Poor flexibility
-Dynamic vs Static Array?
Aspect	        Static Array	Dynamic Array
Memory Location	Stack	        Heap
Size Decision	Compile-time	Runtime
Resizing	    Not possible	Possible (costly)
Deallocation	Automatic	    Manual
Speed	        Faster	        Slightly slower
Risk	        Stack overflow	Memory leak


3. Leetcode 344
-Use swap until index n/2
-Cannot reduce down beyond O(n), because reversal is a linear information problem = linear time.

4. Leetcode 1672
-Find sum of each row
-Compare with maxSum.
-Time Comlexity : O(mxn)

5. Leetcode 1752
-Rotation happens around a point.
-Find drop point(s).
-Increase dropCount.
-If dropCount > 1 , return false.
-Time Complexity : O(n)

1. Stack?
 - A data structure which can be visualised in a form of a pile where you can only interact with the top.
 - Follows the principle of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).
 - Stacked plates , browser history , undo functions.
 - Why stack and not array? It enforces order of resolution , not just storage.

2. Strings - Stacks?
 - Strings are a timeline of characters that may or may not get along with their past.
 - Push = delaying and pop means cancelling the elements

3. Monotonic Stack?
 - A stack that maintains an order so future elements can resolve past ones efficiently.

" The top of the string is the most recent character whos fate is still undecided. "

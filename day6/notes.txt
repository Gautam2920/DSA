1. Two Pointer?
 - tracking two indices.
 - one pointer - linear scan while two pointer - structure + constraint

 - Types:
  -Same direction :
  - Starts from same end.
  - Opposite direction :
   - Starts from both ends and moves inward.

 - Shrinking search space:
  - Moves indexes closer to reduce the space.

2. Prefix Sum? :
 - Compute once , store , dont compute again.
 - reduces time complexity
 - prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + nums[i]

- Leetcode 1480:
 - simple prefix sum logic.

-Leetcode 167:
 - Two opp direction pointer left and right
 - currentSum = nums[left] + nums[right]
 - equal to target? return index +1
 - too big? right--
 - too small? left++

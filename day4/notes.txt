1. Sliding Window Technique?
- Used for subarray or substring or window.

- Maintains a range , which moves step-by-step , updates result incrementally.

- Uses prev window result to do computations for next window.

- Types:
 - Fixed Size Sliding Window:
  - Fix the size of window.
  - Operate first window.
  - Slide window by 1.
 - Variable Size Sliding Window:
  - Increase right pointer one-by-one to meet conditions.
  - In case of condition not matching , decrease size of left pointer by one.
  - Match condition and move right pointer by one.
  - Loop till the end of the array.

- Time Complexity : O(n)

- Leetcode 643:
 - Fixed Sliding Window Problem.
 - Initialise currentSum
 - Add elements of the window 0 to k-1
 - initiale maxSum and add currentSum to it.
 - add new element to the window and subtract the first element in the window
 - update maxSum if currentSum > maxSum
 - loop until n-1 elements
 - return maxSum / k.
 - Time Comlexity : O(n)

- Leetcode 121:
 - for number of days < 3 , return
 - track currentProfit by comparing todayPrice with minPricetSoFar
 - currentProfit > maxProfit , maxProfit = currentProfit.

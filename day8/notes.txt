 1. Hash Maps?
  - Data structure used to store key value pairs-
  - Helps replace O(n2) approach by reducing the time complexity to constant time lookups.
  - Store the info once and retrieve it in O(1) avg time

 2. Frequency Maps?
  - Key represents the identity of data and value represents the information about the identity

 3. Prefix Maps?
  - Used to know how many time a required previous prefixSum has occured.

 4. Strings?
  - There is no such thing as a “string problem.” There are array problems with character constraints.
  - Arrays of Characters
  - Substring uses slidingWindow , twoPointer etc

 5. Recursion?
  - Each recursive call is a paused state.
  - It is simply function calls stacked on top of each other.
  - Needs a base case to avoid stack overflow.
  - Deep recursion may cause stack overflow if the recursion depth exceeds stack capacity.

 - Leetcode 242:
  - Diff len , false
  - create freq map empty
  - traverse s , count++
  - traverse t , count--
  - for count < 0 , false
  - complete traversal , true

 - Leetcode 387:
  - traverse s , count++ in map
  - traverse s again 
  - first char with freq == 1 
  - return char

 - Leetcode 217:
  - define hash set 
  - traverse the array and keep count
  - if count > 1 , true
  - else false
